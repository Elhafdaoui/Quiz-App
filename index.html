          <p>An IQ test is an assessment that measures a range of cognitive abilities and provides a score that is intended to serve as a measure of an individual's intellectual abilities and potential. IQ tests are among the most commonly administered psychological tests.</p>
          <p>In order to understand what these scores really mean, it is essential to look at exactly how these test scores are calculated. Today, many tests are standardized and scores are derived by comparing individual performance against the norms for the individual's age group. While many tests utilize similar methods to derive their scores, it is also important to note that each test is different and scoring methods may not be the same from one test to another.</p>

          <a href="#">History Of IQ testing</a>
          
          <p>French psychologist Alfred Binet created the first intelligence test in the early 1900s. However, modern IQ testing in the United States stems from the work of Henry Herbert Goddard. Goddard was a psychologist who earned his doctorate in psychology from Clark University in 1899. He translated the Binet test from French to English. This test was used to test basic intellectual functions in U.S. school children and to support mental health diagnoses.</p>
          <p>Goddard remains a controversial figure in the history of psychology. This is due to his argument that adults with low IQs shouldn’t procreate. Thankfully, society has largely moved on from such viewpoints. Today, there are numerous IQ tests that are used for different purposes, but most are used to help diagnose learning disabilities.</p>

           <h2>How to Get an IQ Test</h2>
           <p>IQ scores are just one piece of the puzzle. These tests still remain inaccessible to many families. Not all public schools use them. Some families may not have access to a doctor or psychologist who can administer the test. This can lead to missed opportunities for crucial testing — especially during a child’s early years when treatment is vital.</p>

           <p>Online IQ tests are available, but you shouldn’t rely on them for a medical diagnosis. If you suspect an intellectual disability in a loved one, don’t wait for your doctor to offer a test. Seek out your options for early testing.</p>

                <h3>Impact of IQ Testing</h3>
         <p>Your IQ can have an impact on different areas of your life including school and work. High scores are often associated with higher achievement in school, while lower scores may be linked to some form of intellectual disability.</p>
         <p>The following is a rough breakdown of various IQ score ranges. Some tests present scores differently and with differing interpretations of what those scores might mean.</p>
